2-3-4 Tree Simulation  2-3-4 trees are multiway trees that can have up to four children and three data items per node.  The 2, 3, and 4 in the name 2-3-4 tree refer to how many links to child nodes can potentially be contained in a given node. For non-leaf nodes, three arrangements are possible: – A node with one data item always has two children – A node with two data items always has three children – A node with three data items always has four children  BY: Danny Boy Noynay, Franklin Okiya, Michael Justin Uyheng, Silas Vincient Talisaysay, Angelo Rey Lumanta
